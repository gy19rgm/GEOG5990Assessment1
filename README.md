## GEOG5990Assessment1
Repository of GEOG5990 Assessment 1 material

This is an Agent Based Model in which sheep move around within a field, eating grass and sharing with neighbouring sheep. Sheep dogs exist in the same field. If a sheep spots a sheepdog, they run in the opposite direction. If a sheep wanders into a dog's vision, they sprint towards the sheep, reducing speed as they get closer. This continues until a. total iterations is reached or, b. all sheep's personal store is full.
